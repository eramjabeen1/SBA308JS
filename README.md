This is a grade processing program which processes students grades by taking course info, assignments, and student submissions.
It checks if assignments belong to the right course, calculates scores, applies a 10% late penalty, and prints the results.

Takes input of course details, assignments, and student submissions.
Loops through submissions and finds the matching assignment.
Checks for late work then applies a 10% penalty if needed.
Calculates scores and converts raw scores into percentages.
Computes final averages then adds up scores and divides by total possible points.
Prints results.

Objects to store the course info, assignments, and student data.
Arrays to hold assignments and submissions.
Loops to process each student and the assignment.
Conditionals to check for errors, any late work, and zero-point assignments.
Math calculations to help convert scores into percentages and to calculate the averages.
Loop control to help stop loops early/skip unnecessary data.

I used....  
5 loops (for break and continue)
3 main objects (CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, learners)
Arrays (assignments, LearnerSubmissions)
Conditionals (if-else for checking errors, late work, etc.)
Functions (getLearnerData)
Math operations (percentages, averages)
String formatting (toFixed(2))
